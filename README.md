### Description

This is an exercise for Epicodus in which a website is created for a fictional new co-working startup with a variety of user priorities. The website was created through a design process featuring user stories, research, sketches of the site on paper, wireframing, prototyping, and coding.

### User Stories

* As a high-powered freelancer looking for a job with this company, I would love to see the appealing visuals of the workspace reflected in the website's presentation.
* As a politician who might want to bring the company in for a government project, I want the website to show that the company can be high-powered as well as inclusive & safe for everyone.
* As a potential investor, I want to see that the business has a unique personality that will lift it above just another boilerplate corporate atmosphere.
* As a possible CTO, I believe that the business' heavy tech day-to-day can be balanced out with the involvement of artists, writers, creatives, and craftspeople from other industries.
* As a future employee, I want an emphasis placed on the fun that can be had at work beyond the daily grind. Communal work areas, foozball tables, etc.
